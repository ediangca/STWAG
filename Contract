Spin To Win and Gain (STWAG) 
Mobile App Project Contract
Parties
This contract is entered into by the 13 founding members and developers of the Spin To Win and Gain (STWAG) Mobile App.
Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application to automate the STWAG fundraising process.
Term
All transactions within the app will be conducted using points instead of currency.
Rationale
A group of 13 individuals voluntarily pools financial resources to support members in terms of health, livelihood, and emergency expenses. To sustain and grow these funds, the group initiated an income-generating project known as Spin to Win and Gain (STWAG). Since January 2025, a temporary gaming app has been used to facilitate fundraising through a spinning wheel game, where numbers 00-99 are available for purchase at Php10.00 per night. A portion of the funds collected contributes to general savings.
However, challenges have emerged, including the inconvenience of manually handling ticket sales, spinning the wheel, and transferring funds. To streamline the process while maintaining the group’s social purpose, a dedicated STWAG mobile app is proposed.

Scope of the Project
a. User Registration & Authentication
•	Members must log in to access the platform.
•	A user cannot log in without a reference or upline code.
•	Every user (unless a root member/one of the 13 founding members) is a downline member.
•	Sign-up bonus: 10 points (non-withdrawable)
•	Cashback: If a user places a bet or tops up five consecutive times, they receive a 1% points or 5 points(which is higher) cashback reward (non-withdrawable).
•	Security Restriction: One user is limited to one device only.
b. Money/Wallet Management
•	Top-up Wallet: Users can add 1 to 1000 points per transaction.
•	Withdrawal: Minimum withdrawal is 10 points.
•	Manual Transactions: All top-ups and withdrawals require a request and admin approval before proceeding.
•	Admin Features: Admins will manage all transaction requests.
c. Game Mechanics and Algorithm
•	Bet Distribution:
o	70% of the total pot (bet amount) is awarded to the winning user(s).
o	10% is allocated to admin/operational expenses.
o	10% goes into the general fund (mother account).
o	10% is distributed as incentives to upline members.
•	Incentive Distribution:
o	Every upline member in the network receives an incentive when a downline places a bet.
o	The base incentive of 3% is reserved for the original 13 founding members.
o	The remaining 7% is allocated to downlines: 
	If the bettor is a proceeding downline, the direct upline receives 7%.
	If there are multiple levels between the bettor and the direct upline, a 2% incentive per level applies until it reaches the next direct upline bettor.
	If the final difference results in 1%, the upline receives only 1%; if the difference is 0%, no incentive is awarded.
	To understand more, please refer to below scenarios.

•	Game Schedule:
o	Spins occur twice daily:
	Morning spin at 10:00 AM
	Evening spin at 8:00 PM
o	Betting closes 30 minutes before each scheduled spin.
•	Betting and Number Selection:
o	Numbers 00-99 are available for betting.
o	Minimum bet per number: 1 point
o	Maximum bet per number: 1000 points
o	Accepted bet denominations: 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 700, 1000
o	Once a number reaches 1000 points in bets, it becomes locked and unavailable for further bets.
•	Spin and Winning Mechanism:
o	If the total bet amount is below 9000 points, the winning number will be one with the lowest bet amount or no bets at all (Win Low Mechanic).
o	If the total bet amount is 9000 points or more, the winning number will be one with the highest bet amount (Win High Mechanic).
o	The winner receives 7x their bet amount (e.g., a bet of 10 points results in 70 points if the number is selected).
o	Number with max bet points(1000 points) will only win once 70% of the total pot (bet amount) is 7000 points or more.
o	There will be 2 spinning wheel for each digit of the number.
d. Other Pages/Features
•	Game Dashboard: Displays the available numbers (00-99) and the current game session.
•	History & Records: The system will store and display past game results and winners for transparency.
Scope Limitations
•	No Online Payment Integration: The app will not support direct online payments or financial transactions. All fund collections and transfers will remain manual.
•	Hosting and Maintenance: Since this is an online mobile app, the 13 founding members will provide the hosting and domain fees for the app.
•	Platform Availability: The development will only focus on Android compatibility.
